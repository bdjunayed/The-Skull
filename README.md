# skull-css

> basic scss library with Susy grid for a random project.

## Instruction / cautions!
> All files with Underscore need to be minimal. I added the bootstrup structure not for using the code here. We are deleting the codes. If you are interested about bootstrap you may follow their repo.

* Let you have a Node projet:

. Copy the skull-css folder inside your projects scss folder and, 
. Import the skull-css/skull-css-custom.scss inside your app.scss. `@import "./skull-scss/skull-css-custom";`
. Install Susy `npm install --save-dev susy`
