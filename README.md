# skull-css

*Susy enabled minimal css library.*

## Instruction / cautions

N.B: All files with Underscore need to be minimal. I added the bootstrup structure not for using the code here. We are deleting the codes. If you are interested about bootstrap you may follow their repo.

### Clone and run 'npm install'

### If you have an exsiting Node projet

Download the zip file from GitHub.
Copy the contents of the “sass” folder and
paste into your project's "scss" folder.

Import the skull-css inside your app.scss file `@import 'styles';`.

### Install Susy

```bash
npm install --save-dev susy
```
